What is a Cashback Website?
A cashback website is a platform of partnerships with retailers who pay commissions for customers brought to their store. Service providers and retailers use the cashback website to pay back a small amount to affiliates or websites that successfully refer transactions to them. The rewards may be in terms of percentage of sales made or a flat rate for each action, depending on each cashback websiteâ€™s policies. 
How Does Cashback Website Work? 
A cashback website allows affiliates to earn commissions from purchases generated. They partner with top brands which pay them commission for referring buyers to their stores, and the best cashback websites share the commission with affiliates who use their links to purchase. 
The cashback sites accumulate earnings in small portions of commission for every transaction made. Once the earnings reach a certain amount, they are withdrawable to the bank account or other financial payout options, such as mobile banking. 
The monetary reward is automatically generated when a purchaser buys through the cashback website or an attached affiliate link. The purchase is confirmed before the commission can be received; hence most affiliate links are trackable. 
Cashback sites pay site users in order to motivate them to continue making transactions via the site. With the rewards, these users are also able to refer friends and family increasing the usage of the sites. The more people use the website to make purchases, the more the site accumulates its earnings.
